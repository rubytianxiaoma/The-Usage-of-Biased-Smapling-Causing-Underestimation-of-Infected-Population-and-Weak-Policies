# Overview
This repo contains code and data for report,"The Usage of Biased Smapling Causing Underestimation of Infected Population and Weak Policies". It was created by TianXiao Ma. The purpose is to create a report that aims to show how does current COVID actual infected cases are substantially underestimated by biased samples with the help of Monte Carlo Model. We detail how to get data obtained in the report below. The sections of this repo are: clean data script and output.

Support dataset folder contains all the dataset used in the paper. -contacttracing.csv The document contains data of daily newly added cases in Ontario.
